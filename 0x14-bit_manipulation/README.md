# 0x14. C - Bit Manipulation

*This project focuses on bit manipulation in the C programming language. It includes several tasks that involve working with bits and bitwise operators. The goal of the project is to enhance your understanding of manipulating bits and develop problem-solving skills.*

**Learning Objectives**

By completing this project, you are expected to achieve the following learning objectives:

* Look for the right source of information without excessive assistance
* Understand how to manipulate bits and utilize bitwise operators effectively
* Demonstrate knowledge of bit manipulation concepts without relying on external resources

**Requirements**

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* Compilation will be done on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the following flags: -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* All files must end with a new line
* Include a **`README.md`** file at the root of the project folder
* Code should follow the Betty style, which will be checked using **`betty-style.pl`** and **`betty-doc.pl`**
* Usage of global variables is not allowed
* Each file should contain no more than 5 functions
* Only the following C standard library functions are permitted: **`malloc`**, **`free`**, and **`exit`**
* Use of functions like **`printf`**, **`puts`**, **`calloc`**, **`realloc`**, etc. is forbidden
* Include the prototypes of all functions and the **`_putchar`** function in a header file named **`main.h`**
* The **`_putchar.c`** file should not be pushed, as it will be provided
* All header files should have include guards
* An auto-review will be launched at the project deadline

## Tasks

The project consists of several tasks, each implemented in a separate file. The following are brief descriptions of each task:


### Task 0: Binary to Unsigned Int

Write a function **`binary_to_uint`** that converts a binary number to an unsigned int. The function takes a string of **`0`** and **`1`** characters as input and returns the converted number. If the input string contains characters other than **`0`** and **`1`**, or if the string is **`NULL`**, the function should return **`0`**.

### Task 1: Print Binary

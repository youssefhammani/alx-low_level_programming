### 0. Preprocessor

**A script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file. The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE; The output should be saved in the file c using :**

```c
	gcc -E $CFILE -o c
```

*The command **`gcc -E $CFILE -o c`** is a command to preprocess a C file using the GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) compiler.*

**The options and arguments used in this command are:**

* **`gcc`** *The command to invoke the GCC compiler.*
* **`-E`** *The option to instruct the compiler to perform only the preprocessing stage of the compilation process. This means that the preprocessor will process the source code and output an expanded version of the code, with all preprocessor directives (#include, #define, #ifdef, etc.) replaced with their corresponding code.*
* **`CFILE`** *This is a shell variable that holds the name of the C file to be preprocessed. The variable is expanded to the file name at runtime.*

* **`-o c`** *This option specifies the name of the output file. In this case, the output file is named `c`*

*Therefore, when you run this command, the GCC compiler preprocesses the C file specified by the $CFILE variable and generates an expanded version of the code, which is then saved to the file named c. This command can be useful for examining the output of the preprocessor, debugging preprocessor directives, or generating intermediate code for further analysis.*

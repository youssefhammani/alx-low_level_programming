# 0x15. C - File I/O

*This project is part of the curriculum for a C programming course, and it is about file I/O. It aims to teach the students how to create, open, close, read and write files, as well as what file descriptors are, and how to use the I/O system calls open, close, read, and write. The project also covers the concept of system calls, file permissions, and flags such as O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, O_RDWR.

The project requires the implementation of several functions that allow the manipulation of files, including read_textfile, which reads a text file and prints it to the POSIX standard output, as well as other functions that allow for the manipulation of file descriptors, such as open, close, read, and write.*
